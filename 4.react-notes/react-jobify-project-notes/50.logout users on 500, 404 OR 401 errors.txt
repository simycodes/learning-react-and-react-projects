logout users on 500, 404 OR 401 errors

IF THE APP GIVES 500, 404 OR 401, ITS BETTER TO LOGOUT THE USER - AS THE USER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH
THE APP - LOGOUT THE USER - SO HE MAY LOGIN AND IN MOST CASES AGAIN SO HE MAY NOT ENCOUNTER THE SAME ISSUE
SUCH AS SERVER DOWN.

EXMAPLE: WHEN LOGGED IN, WHEN USER TRIES TO GET ALL JOBS, IF A SERVER DOWN OR 404 ERROR OR AUTHENTICATED ERROR
OCCURS - LOGOUT THE USER - BECAUSE IN THIS CASE THE USER SHOULD NOT BE INTERACTING WITH THE APPLICATION.


// FUNCTION TO GET ALL THE JOBS
  const getJobs = async () => {
    let url = `/jobs`;
    dispatch({ type: GET_JOBS_BEGIN });

    try {
      const { data } = await authFetch(url); // authFetch(url) is actually authFetch.get(url);
      const { jobs, totalJobs, numOfPages } = data;
      dispatch({
        type: GET_JOBS_SUCCESS,
        payload: {
          jobs,
          totalJobs,
          numOfPages,
        },
      })
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error.response);
      // IF 500, 404 OR 401 ERRORS OCCUR, LOGOUT THE USER SO HE CAN LOGIN AGAIN
      logoutUser();
    }
    clearAlert()
  }
