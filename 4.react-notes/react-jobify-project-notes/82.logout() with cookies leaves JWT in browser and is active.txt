A logout() functionality with cookies having the JWT, leaves JWT in browser and active, hence a reload of the page will make a request to get user data using the JWT and the user will be back again in the app like the log out never happened.

Hence its important, at this point to have a logout routes that will destroy the JWT cookiw once the user logs out.


// ROUTE TO LOG OUT THE USER( DESTROY THE JWT COOKIE)
const logout = async (req, res) => {
  res.cookie('token', 'logout', { // in making cookie - logout will hold actual token to be stored as cookie - here logout is just an empty string
    httpOnly: true,
    expires: new Date(Date.now()),
  });
  res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json({ msg: 'user logged out!' });
};
