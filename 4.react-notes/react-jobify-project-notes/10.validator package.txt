npm install validator

This library validates and sanitizes strings only.

If you're not sure if your input is a string, coerce it using input + ''. Passing anything other than a string will 
result in an error.

 email: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, 'Please Provide Your Email'],
        unique: true, 
        validate : { // THIS IS CUSTOM VALIDATOR FUNCTION(reference used) ADDED AS PROPERTY-OBJECT
            validate:validator.isEmail, //validator.Email checks if email is valid
            message: 'Please provide a valid email'
        }
    },
