Putting the select:false on a propety model makes this property to not be displayed to the user.BUT when creating
a (on user.create() function - it does not work) new user-instance ,the password is sent out hence, the outing process 
is done by putting separate properties on the output AS DONE IN PROJECT IN REGISTER CONTROLLER. 


password: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, 'Please Provide Your Password'],
        minlength: 6,
        select: false,
    },
