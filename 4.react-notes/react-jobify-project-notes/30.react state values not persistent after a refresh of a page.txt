The react state values not persistent after a refresh of a page,hence the data returned from the database after
logging are lost after a page is refreshed(they are not like session values that still browser untill destroyed and 
not disturbed by page refreshing).

In order to overcome this effect, the data from the database that keep a user loged in after logging into a site
are stored as local storage and in case of page refresh, the data keeping user logged in is fetched from the local
storage and user is kept signed in.
