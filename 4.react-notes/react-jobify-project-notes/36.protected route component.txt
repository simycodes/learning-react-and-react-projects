The protected route component is used like php login session variables that are checked to see if a user is logged
or not and redirect the user.

In react the protected route is wrapped around each component that makes up a page whose access can only be given if
a user is logged else the user is redirected.


THE PROTECTED WORKS LIKE BELOW


function ProtectedRoute({ children }) {
//  CHILDREN REFERS TO IMMEDIATE SUB COMPONENT(SharedLayout) 
  const { user } = useAppContext();
  // IF NO USER IS LOGGED IN - REDIRECT TO THE LANDING PAGE
  if(!user) {
    return <Navigate to="/landing" />
  }
  return (
    children
  )
}

WRAPPING IT ON PAGE COMPONENTS

<Route path="/" element={
        <ProtectedRoute> {/* GET TO INDEX & SUB PAGES AFTER LOGIN, ELSE REDIRECT USER */}
          <SharedLayout />  
        </ProtectedRoute>}> 
        {/* ADDING SUB PAGES TO THE HOME PAGE(WHICH DASHBOARD IN THIS CASE) */}
        <Route index element={<Stats />}/> {/* index keyword makes stats to be home page */}
        <Route path="all-jobs" element={<AllJobs />}/>
        <Route path="add-job" element={<AddJob />}/>
        <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />}/>
      </Route>
