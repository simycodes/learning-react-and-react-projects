In order to get the JWT on the api sent via the tokens, the cookie-parser package needs to be used to parse the incoming cookies before they are finally used in the api app.


// ALLOW RECEIVING AND PARSE INCOMING JSON AND COOKIES ON POST REQUESTS ETC
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cookieParser());


Even though a Cookie header is sent, accessing the JWT on the api is done through the req variable (of (req, res) {}), where the cookie is stored in the cookies property.

req.cookies
console.log(req.cookies);

// FUNCTION TO AUTHENTICATE EACH USER ACCESSING A PROTECTED ROUTE
const auth = async (req, res, next) => {
  // CHECK IF HEADERS HAVE THE BEAR WITH JWT TOKEN
  console.log(req.cookies);
}
