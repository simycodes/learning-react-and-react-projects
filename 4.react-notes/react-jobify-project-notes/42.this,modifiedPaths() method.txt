this.modifiedPaths() - when used in the schema is used to show the path/VALUES that is being updated. It gives an array 
of the paths that will be updated such as ['name'] if the name of the user will be updated or is being updated.

AND this.isModified('name') checks if a given path is being updated - in this case is name of user being updated

UserSchema.pre('save', async function(){
    // console.log(this.modifiedPaths()); // DISPLAY VALUES/PATH/FIELD BEING UPDATED IN THE UPDATE ROUTE
    // console.log(this.isModified('name')); // checks if a given path/field is being updated - in this case is name of user being updated
    if(!this.isModified('password')) return 
        const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
        this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, salt);  
});
