WHEN USING AXIOS AND INTERCEPETORS ,You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.

INTERCEPTORS ARE LIKE AXIOS MIDDLEWARE THAT ACT ON THE DATA RECEIVED OR SENT BEFORE IT GOES TO THE TRY AND CATCH
BLOCKS

https://axios-http.com/docs/interceptors

// Add a request interceptor
axios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {
    // Do something before request is sent
    return config;
  }, function (error) {
    // Do something with request error
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });

// Add a response interceptor
axios.interceptors.response.use(function (response) {
    // Any status code that lie within the range of 2xx cause this function to trigger
    // Do something with response data
    return response;
  }, function (error) {
    // Any status codes that falls outside the range of 2xx cause this function to trigger
    // Do something with response error
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });
