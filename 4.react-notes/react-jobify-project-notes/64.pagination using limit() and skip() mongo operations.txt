skip() is used to skip a given number of records returned from the database (as a way of filtering and adding pagination functionality), just before sending data to the front end.
ILLUSTRACTION
skip(1) : This will skip the first document returned from the database.

limit() is used to limit the number of to get and display to the front end.So initialy decide how many number of
jobs to skip and then limit the amout of jobs to get and eventually display to the frontend.
 

 BASIC SETUP EXAMPLE 

 let result = Job.find(queryObject);

// PAGINATION FUNCTIONALITY
  const limitNumberOfJobs = 10;
  const numberOfJobsToSkip = 1;

  result = result.skip(numberOfJobsToSkip).limit(limitNumberOfJobs)
