jwt.verify() method is used to compare the JWT token user login in with(and accesses protected routes with) to the
JWT_SECRET token to ensure the the users JWT has not been tempered with or is not incorrect, but correct and safe
to be used to access the API routes and database.

jwt.verify() method returns the userId that is then used to modify the database, other returned values is when the 
token was initilised and when it will expire.

try {
    const payload = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    // console.log(payload); 
    // payload is: { userId: '63e69ee471eea96576349459', iat: 1676480115, exp: 1676566515 }
    // attach the user request object
    // req.user = payload
    req.user = { userId: payload.userId };
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    throw new UnAuthenticatedError('Authentication invalid');
  }
