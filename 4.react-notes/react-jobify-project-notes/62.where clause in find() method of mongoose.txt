sql 'where' clause in find() method of mongoose is passed by the use of an object having properties stating the
where condition that must be met when geting data from the database.

In expression below, createdBy:req.user.userId can be read in sql as, where createdBy = req.user.userId, Hence the
statement

Job.find({createdBy:req.user.userId}); can be interepreted in sql as 

select * from jobs where createdBy = req.user.userId

Multiple Where clauses can be added in the find() method the same way select can be chained with may where clauses.

NOTE: FILTERING PROCESS IN THE BACKEND JUST INVOLVES THE DYNAMIC CHANGING OF THE WHERE CLAUSES WHERE SEARCH FOR
DATA IN THE DATABASE.AND THESE CLAUSES ARE PASSED IN THE find() METHOD WHEN GETING DATA FROM THE DATABASE.
