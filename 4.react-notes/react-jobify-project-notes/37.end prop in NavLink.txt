If the end prop is used, it will ensure this component isn't matched as "active" when its descendant paths are matched.

<NavLink to='' end>
  {({ isActive }) =>
     isActive ? (
           <text style={{color: blue}}>Home</text>
     ) : (                      
           <text>Home</text>
     )
  }
