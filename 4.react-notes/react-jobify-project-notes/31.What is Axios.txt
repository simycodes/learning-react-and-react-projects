Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. 

It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). 
On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

Transform request and response data
Cancel requests
Automatic transforms for JSON data
Client side support for protecting against XSRF
