- The useState() method/function is a method defined inside react.
- The useState() preserves the state of a value(variables) and triggers a re-render of a component.
- The useState() is used to change states of components-change their innerHTML,attributes,css etc, fast
and efficiently as it triggers components to re-render and show new updated changes in a component.

 - useState() allows you to define and assign a variable & function and connect this variable to the
   defined function that can easily access it and change it.

it comes into a JS document as a named import,actual name its created in react is used when importing
it

import { useState } from 'react';

- useState function uses two arguments, a variable and a function handler and it returns an array.
- the handler as the second argument is used to change/control the first argument variable which holds
  a components state.

  // useCase takes 2 arguments(variable,handler function)& returns an array
  // The first argument can be an int,string,array,object etc
  const firstArgumentVariable = useState(1)[0];
  const secondArgumentFunction = useState(1)[1];
  console.log(firstArgumentVariable,secondArgumentFunction);

  - first argument as an array
    const[people, setPeople] = React.useState([]);

  // using destructuring to get values from useState()-usual coding way
  // text holds the value inside useState() which is Random Text

  let [text, setText] = useState("Random Text");


// NOTE
// useState() allows you to define and assign a variable & function and connect this 
// variable to the defined function that can easily access it and change it.
// this defination process happen immediately you assign an argument to a useState function
// like this useState("Hello World"),variable will hold Hello World and function will have
// access to this variable and this variable and function can be accessed through destructuring
// like this : let [text, setText] = useState("Hello World");
