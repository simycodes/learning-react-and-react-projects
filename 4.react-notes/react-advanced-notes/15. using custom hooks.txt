USING CUSTOM HOOKS

custom hooks are used to implement reusability of process/code/logic. Implementing the reusing of code for things
such as fetching data and any logic and not resuing html/jsx code as that is done using components.

A custom hook is a  reusable hook-function (a component without no return of html/jsx) that is user defined.It has
logic that can be used in other components, in short its just a function that can be called in other components for
its services.It mainly returns an object holding state values that need to be used in the calling components.

A custom hook behaves like a usual function and is different from a react component as it does not return jsx or html
but returns objects and state values-variables needed for use by other components.

A custom hook also makes use of other inbuilt hooks such as useState and useEffect as it uses use state variables and
logic from useEffects and also fetch api etc to perform its logic needed by other components.

In React, a custom Hook is a function that starts with the word “use” and may call other Hooks. 

custom hooks are available on net - jsut search custom hooks and libraries will be there.
