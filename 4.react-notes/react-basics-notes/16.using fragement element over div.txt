When you want to enclose JSX with element other than a div as the parent 
element in a component,you use the <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> which is
also simply written as <> </>.

Using the fragement <> </> will be only effect in the component but it wont be
rendered as HTML element on the browser as a div would be.
