In order to add JS variables in innerHTML of elements in react,a JS environment has
to be created using the { },then inbetween these braces a JS varible or logic be
added and it will work.
The braces are actually used in the return() body to use and access JS,before that
but still inside the component,JS can be directly be used without introducing {}

const Book = () => {
  const title = "I Love You to the Moon and Back"; //this direct JS no { }
  return(
    <article className='book'>
       <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8144Vic9C5L._AC_UL900_SR900,600_.jpg" alt="This is a book" width="300px" />
       <h1>{ title }</h1>
       <h4>Amelia Hepworth</h4>
    </article>
  )
}


Its not only inside innnerHTML that JS can be added but also be initialised to
attribute values and used in inline CSS styling
