A react component is very similar to/is a function.

Its created with same exact syntax as a function except it has to start with a 
capital letter and has to always return something - usually JSX

It accepts arguments which are refered to as props,which is uses for its logic in order
t produce the needed output.

It is made up maily of HTML elements which are referred to as JSX elements and JS
varibles that are placed in the innerHTML of the JSX elements.

A component is maily used for making and rendering several instances that holds
different data,each representing a different item,such as various books of
a library or products of a shop.
In this ability a component works as a class from which various instnaces are created
that hold different data reprenting different items.And the passing of various data
is make possible through the use of component arguments/props and the use of a for
loop generate several instances of a component.
