attributes in react are in camelcase and using a class for css -the class attribute
is className and not just class

In below example - Onclick as attribute,className as CSS attribute commonly used
as 'class' only in normal CSS and JS syntax.

function Greeting() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>This is my first component</h4>
      <button OnClick="changeColor()" className="btnColor">
         Click Me
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
