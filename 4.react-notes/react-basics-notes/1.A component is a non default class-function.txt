Usual react components are created as a non default class-function, whose instances
are created by non default component constructor-call that passes in arguments/props
that the componet class-function uses.

Its a non default class-function because its  values are initialised by arguments
from the outside which are also known as props/properties.For this reason components
are created in this way so they can be reused easily to create various instances or
objects of themselves.

initialisng components with static data does not really give a programmer the power
of using components in react.

//THE NON DEFAULT COMPONENT

const Book = (props) => {
  console.log(props);
  const { img, title, author} = props;
  //const { img, title, author} = props.books;
  return(
    <article className='book'>
       <img src={ img } alt="This is a book" width="300px" />
       <h1>{ title }</h1>
       <h4>{ author.toUpperCase() }</h4>
    </article>
  )
}

//THE NON DEFAULT COMPONENT CONSTRUCTOR-INSTANCE

<Book img={img} title={title} author={author}></Book>
